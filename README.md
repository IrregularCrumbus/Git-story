----------------------------------------------------------------------- PROMPT -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From birth, your parents have done everything they could to stop you from going out during a full moon. 
At the age of 18, curiosity overwhelms you and you sneak out of the house during a full moon. You take a peek at the moon, and suddenly you turn into a log cabin. You are a werehouse.

  My phone buzzed to life and let out a screech.
  I was seventeen years old at the time. The date was Tuesday, November thirtieth, 1926, and I was enjoying the start of my weekend the way anyone else like me would; I was playing Team Fortress 2 on my brand new Chromebook, going on a massive tear with a frying pan and a death wish. It was hypnotizing, in a way, listening to the sounds of early tinnitus and gibbus snipers screaming. Of course, since I was in a trance, my phone's unecessarily loud yelp made me jump to the point in which I found my head lodged in the ceiling. After twenty minutes, I freed myself from what was thankfully not my drywall tomb, and checked my phone.

  On it, was the new Team Fortress 3 game! I was estatic and forgot all about how I almost died. I pulled out my chromebook and started playing in the dark with an endless supply of chips and Mountain Dew. Hours turned into days, and days turned into weeks. My birthday was in 2 hours and I had totally forgot about it as I was... idk building fortresses (idk what that game is). I looked at the time on my chromebook and it read 11:59...
  
   I lost all feeling in my body. I felt very still and very... wood like? I could see everything, I could hear everything, I could feel EVERYTHING. This sensation overtook my body... well, not my body because, I don't think I'm in my body anymore. It was painful at first, then it just got very irritating, what am I supposed to do... just sit there?
