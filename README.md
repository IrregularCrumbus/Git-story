----------------------------------------------------------------------- PROMPT -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From birth, your parents have done everything they could to stop you from going out during a full moon. 
At the age of 18, curiosity overwhelms you and you sneak out of the house during a full moon. You take a peek at the moon, and suddenly you turn into a log cabin. You are a werehouse.

  My phone buzzed to life and let out a screech.
  I was seventeen years old at the time. The date was Tuesday, November thirtieth, 1926, and I was enjoying the start of my weekend the way anyone else like me would; I was playing Team Fortress 2 on my brand new Chromebook, going on a massive tear with a frying pan and a death wish. It was hypnotizing, in a way, listening to the sounds of early tinnitus and gibbus snipers screaming. Of course, since I was in a trance, my phone's unecessarily loud yelp made me jump to the point in which I found my head lodged in the ceiling. After twenty minutes, I freed myself from what was thankfully not my drywall tomb, and checked my phone.

  Huh it's from my parents, "The full moon is coming. Make sure you are in the basement before sun down." I just sigh and start to get my stuff. Every year since my birth I have been in the basement during a fullmoon. I just ask, why it's not like I'm a werewolf or anything. I mean they don't exsist. Right?
